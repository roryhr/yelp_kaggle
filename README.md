# Multi-label classification network

This repository contains the code I used for the
[Yelp Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-restaurant-photo-classification).

My primary motivation is to use the competition as a learning opportunity. 
I've developed an object-oriented model model which exposes the familiar scikit-learn API. 

Beyond the application of standard development practices to data science, I've implemented the [latest and greatest convolutional network](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) in Keras.

## Running the network

The competition involves labeling each image from nine possible labels. 
If we were to one-hot encode you'd have `2**9 = 512` classes, not far from the 1000 classes in the ImageNet competition. 
Their deepest network required 11 billion FLOPs and a lot of time and resources to train. Consider yourself warned. 


# What's the model look like? 

Glad you asked! Here's the *34-layer* residual model.
